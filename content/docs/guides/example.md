		a. normal distribution (for generating mean and variance)
		b. homoscedasticity (grow at the same rate)
			i. not true for function aging 
			ii. always mix the plateau and decline if cross-sectional

			iii. longitudinal analysis
	2. Model the average thing within the data. rarely fits everybody. highly insensitive to some types of change
		a. data are disproportioned by the healthier people because sick people will die soon or lose the data (survivor bias, attrition bias)
	3. Norm versus diagnostic norm -Memory clinic data
		a. norms not only applied to the population but also to a different sample

Be skeptical and think what is the assumptions for cross-sectional study. It is the average of the average. Research question is when and how, cross-sectional often ignoring the when.
